🚀 AI Agent for News-Based Company Data Analysis using Model Context Protocol (MCP), GPT-4o & AntV 📊🧠
I just built an AI-powered agent that:
✅ Scrapes and processes news articles to extract insights about companies
✅ Uses OpenAI GPT-4o for analysis, summarization, and trend detection
✅ Leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) to generate dynamic, real-time charts with AntV
✅ Fully deployed in Flask and orchestrated with Langflow
🔍 What It Does:
•	Performs automated data analysis on news content related to companies
•	Extracts sentiment, topics, and activity trends using GPT-4o
•	Visualizes structured data with MCP-driven AntV charts
•	Supports decision-making for analysts, executives, or investors
⚙️ Tech Stack:
•	Python / Flask
•	OpenAI GPT-4o
•	Model Context Protocol (MCP)
•	AntV (@antv/mcp-server-chart)
•	Langflow for modular workflow design
The project is open-source and production-ready.
